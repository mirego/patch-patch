# PatchPatch

PatchPatch changes Rails’ default behavior of mapping `PUT` and `PATCH` requests on resources to the same action.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'patch-patch'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install patch-patch
```

## Usage

Let’s say we have a RESTful API with a single `users` resource.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Foo::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :users
end
```

### Before

```bash
$ rake routes
   Prefix Verb   URI Pattern               Controller#Action
    users GET    /users(.:format)          users#index
          POST   /users(.:format)          users#create
 new_user GET    /users/new(.:format)      users#new
edit_user GET    /users/:id/edit(.:format) users#edit
     user GET    /users/:id(.:format)      users#show
          PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)      users#update
          PUT    /users/:id(.:format)      users#update
          DELETE /users/:id(.:format)      users#destroy
```

### After

```bash
$ rake routes
   Prefix Verb   URI Pattern               Controller#Action
    users GET    /users(.:format)          users#index
          POST   /users(.:format)          users#create
 new_user GET    /users/new(.:format)      users#new
edit_user GET    /users/:id/edit(.:format) users#edit
     user PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)      users#partial_update
          GET    /users/:id(.:format)      users#show
          PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)      users#update
          PUT    /users/:id(.:format)      users#update
          DELETE /users/:id(.:format)      users#destroy
```

_Note: the old `PATCH` route is still there but it will never be matched since our `#partial_update` route comes first. The old `PUT` route will still route to `#update` though._
